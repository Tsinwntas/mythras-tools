<p>Draw, sheah, withdraw or reload a weapon takes one turn cycle.</p>
<p>Retrieving a nearby dropped weapon requires two turns, one to move and reach down for the weapon, and a second to return to a redied stance.</p>
<p><i>Tsinik's Notes: If a character want's to do something cool to pick it up and be ready in a single turn, I might allow it if the idea is cool enough and I will accompany it with the appropriate roll.</i></p>
