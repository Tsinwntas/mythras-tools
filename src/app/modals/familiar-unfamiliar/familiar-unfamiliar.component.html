<p>If a combatant is using an unfamiliar weapon in conjuction with a trained weapon, such as a shield, then the trained Combat Style is used, but is one grade harder. This simulates the compensation in the overall style the combatant must make (adjusting balance, accounting for heft and so on) necessary to use a combination of trained and untrained weapons.</p>
