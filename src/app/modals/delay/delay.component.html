<p>The character conserves their action so that they can instread perform a Reactive Action at a later time, sucha as an <open-modal modal="interrupt">Interrupt</open-modal> or <open-modal modal="parry">Parry</open-modal>. The Action Point cost of delaying is covered by whatever act is finally performed. If the delayed action is not taken before the charater's next turn, then the character is considered to have <open-modal modal="dither">Dithered</open-modal>, and the Action Point is lost.</p>
