The flat leaf-shaped spearhead was composed of iron and its weight was counterbalanced by an iron butt-spike.[2][3][4] (cf Sarissa) The rear of the spear was capped with a spike called a sauroter (Greek: saurwtnr), Greek for \"lizard killer\". It functionally served as a counter-weight to give balance. This spike had several uses. It could be used to stand the spear up or used as a secondary weapon if the spearhead was broken off.[5] If the shaft of the dory was broken or if the iron point was lost, the remaining portion could still function.[6] Though its combat range would be reduced, the dory's complete length would have lessened the chance of a single break rendering it ineffective. Additionally, any enemies that had fallen could be dispatched by the warriors marching over them in the back ranks of the phalanx who were holding their spears in a vertical position.[5] (Wikipedia)",

Occasionally, glaive blades were created with a small hook on the reverse side to better catch riders. Such blades are called glaive-guisarmes.",
